This is an assignment project using Vue 3 and Quasar.

## Specifications
The project focuses on creating a web application (inspired by the real Aspire application) divided in 2 sections:
1. CSS Challenge: <br/>
 The candidate should convert the designs in an application with focus on design fidelity and usage of libraries and tools aligned with the Code Challenge.

   - Desktop View: https://xd.adobe.com/view/80c753f2-db2f-4dfc-b6c2-ce39a4c787f0-d594/screen/7d8639be-16a2-4dc6-9ddc- c3bcd8d8f1ee/ (optional)
2. Code Challenge: <br/>
The task is to make the UI built with the CSS challenge dynamic and interactive. <br/>
General notes:
   - application can be built with any tools / libraries (if needed)
   - application should use an API architecture, where dummy data can be returned from the APIs directly within the JS code, no real server side code is required
   - the data can be stored in localStorage or stage management system
   - on the start up of the application, some cards should be already added by the system without need to prepare a layout without cards

  Interactions needed for the challenge:
   - Add new card:<br/>
    - open a modal/page where the user can add the card name and submit the new card 
    - the expiration date and card number will be randomly generated by the system.
    - the card will be appended in the carousel together with the other cards
 - Freeze/Unfreeze card
   - on click of the freeze card the card will get the status of frozen
   - the frozen card will look different from the others (UI not defined by the challenge and up to the candidate, but it can be a simple opacity applied)
   - the freeze button will change label in unfreeze for the frozen card
   - allow the possibility to rollback the card state clicking again the same button and unfreezing the card
 - Cancel card
   - on click open a modal where a confirmation action is asked 
   - remove card from the list
